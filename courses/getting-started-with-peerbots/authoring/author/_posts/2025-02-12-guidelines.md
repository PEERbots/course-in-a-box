title: Authoring Overview

## Before We Start

Before we start with discussing how to author, make sure you've already gone through the basics of the control module. You need to understand how you or others would use the interactions you design, before you can effectively design them.

## Authoring Guidelines

In that vein, we recommend starting with some theory. Go through the [Peerbots Content Authoring Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OuuhuPrlIWlhrXEF_3tie8YI4bf3-kQNTYyFWuVF2l4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Authoring Process

Typically, when we write a document or author an interaction, we go through multiple writing stages:

1. First, we start with **ideating**, brainstorming and dumping our creative thoughts.
2. Second, we might go back and **edit** different parts of the the writing.
3. Third, we might make some granular **tweaks** to modify some parts of the content.

Inspired by this process, we've created three kinds of interfaces for authoring robot interactions in the Peerbots platform. Let's go over them in the next submodule.
