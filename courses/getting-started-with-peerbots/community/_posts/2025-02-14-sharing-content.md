## Publishing Content

We encourage you to be a part of our Peerbots community and contribute your expertise so the entire community can benefit. One way in which you can contribute is by publishing content! This will make your content publicly available to the community.

## Your Public Profile

We recommend starting by updating your public profile to include a bit of a description about yourself so people can get an understanding of your expertise, whether that be through your credentials, interests, or passions.

{% include interactive_check.html statement="Update your profile on the Content Marketplace. (Go to the content marketplace, sign in, select 'My Profile' from the description and edit the information you see there.)" %}

## Content Descriptions

Each set of templates (or content collection) can have a description that walks people through what your intentions with the content are, any advice you have on how to use it effectively, and a legend for your label colors (if applicable).

You can update your content descriptions from the Content Marketplace. There are two ways to access a content page:

1. You can start from the [My Content tab in the app](app.peerbots.org/dash/content) and select "View in the content marketplace" on a particular selection.
2. Or, you can view [your content in the marketplace](market.peerbots.org/my/content) directly.

{% include interactive_check.html statement="Select one of your content collections and go to its content page from the Peerbots App" %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="Select one of your content collections and go to its content page from the My Content tab on the content marketplace" %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="Update your content's description with something informative, providing guidance to someone who has yet to learn the topic." %}

## Listing Content

Once you're satisfied with the content you have created and described, you can share it publicly by selecting "list this publicly for free" from the content page on the marketplace. **Note** that you will not be able to make that content private again.

> If you erroneously published content that needs to be taken down. Please reach out to [team@peerbots.org](mailto:team@peerbots.org?subject=Make My Public Content Private Please)

{% include interactive_check.html statement="Go to a content page and identify the button to list content publiicly." %}

## Practice Before You Publish

Before you publish your content to the community, make sure you practice how to use it. Practicing might give you ideas on how to improve content to fit a broader audience or a particular one and it might give you insight into a conversation path that you hadn't considered. Check out the [practice submodule](/modules/refine/practice) to learn more.
