## Private Sharing through File Sharing

Another way to share content privately is through importing and exporting. In the Peerbots controller, you'll see buttons for "Import" and "Export" and with each of those you can save and load content templates as a Template file (.json) or a Palette file (.csv). The Palette files are from an older version of Peerbots and don't support several new features of the platform such as Label colors and Log buttons.

Once you have a file, you can share it the same way you share any other file. For example, you can email it or put it in a shared drive like Google Drive or Dropbox.

## Try it out

Give it a try, export and import a file.

{% include interactive_check.html statement="On the control page, export a template as a file." %}

Once you've exported that file, try importing it again.

{% include interactive_check.html statement="On the control page, import a template from a file you already exported." %}

## Sharing

Now you can share various templates privately with your community. We encourage you to publish content publicly when it is refined, but while you're still working on it, sharing privately is a great way to get feedback and improve your work.
