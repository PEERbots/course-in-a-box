## Social Robot? What's that?

At Peerbots, we think of social robots as any embodied character that you can socially interact with, for example, that you can talk to. There are several types of social robots. Most notably, socially assistive robots, are those that use their social interaction to help people.

But enough with the jargon, you can think of a social robot as anything with a character that you can talk to. Social robots can appear in many shapes and sizes, and can have different capabilities.

You've probably seen and interacted with social robots before if you've been to a theme park or haunted house. You probably just didn't think of them as robots because they embody the character so well.

## Examples of Social Robots

Here are some examples of social robots in the more academic sense:

## What can they do?

Social robots mostly just talk but they can also move around and gesture as a way to communicate socially as well. But by talking, they can accomplish so much by connecting with people, educating, helping, or entertaining them.
