## What is the Peerbots Platform?

The Peerbots platform is a set of tools that allow you to setup, use, and design for social robots. You can use _some or all_ of these tools as it makes sense for you. The diagram below explains many of the components of the platform.

The Peerbots Platform tools are as follows:

- Robot Face - Turn any screen into a robot face
- Robot Controller - Connect to and control a robot or robot face
- Authoring Interface - Design a social robot interaction
- Practice Interface - Test out social robot interactions with an imaginary audience
- Interaction Reports - Review and reflect on an interaction
- Content Marketplace - Share and acquire existing and vetted interactions

Each of these tools is designed for a different set of expertise and for use in different contexts.
Some of these tools will make sense for you to incorporate into your use of Peerbots but don't feel pressured to use everything! Start small and incorporate more tools as you see fit.
