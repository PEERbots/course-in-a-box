## Standing on the shoulders of giants

Peerbots' community of amazing experts is the most valuable component of the Peerbots platform and you get to benefit and contribute to that expertise. With the [Peerbots Content Marketplace](market.peerbots.org), you can browse and acquire content that you can use in your facilitated robot interactions.

When you acquire content that is freely available on the marketplace, you will make a copy of that content for you to edit. This content will then show up in your content both on the [marketplace](market.peerbots.org/my/content) and on the [app](https://app.peerbots.org/dash/content/) but make sure you're signed in to see those.

Try it out!

{% include interactive_check.html statement="Load the content you copied in the controller." %}

## Practice Makes Perfect

Once you acquire content, make sure you practice how to use it before you try it out with a live audience. Check out the [practice submodule](/modules/refine/practice) to learn more.
