## Tracking Interactions

With the Peerbots controller, you can track interactions and generate reports to see what happened in the interaction.

{% include interactive_check.html statement="Start tracking an interaction." %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="Select buttons from the controller." %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="View the report from the sidebar." %}

## Reflecting on Interactions

Upon reviewing the interaction report, you'll find some helpful information about what was covered in an interaction. This can help you improve future interactions by noticing which content was well received or which content might be helpful to create.

## Download for external analysis

You can also download the interaction details as a CSV to load in Excel or your favorite spreadsheet software for custom analysis.

{% include interactive_check.html statement="From the report, download the interaction as a CSV." %}

{% include interactive_progress.html %}
