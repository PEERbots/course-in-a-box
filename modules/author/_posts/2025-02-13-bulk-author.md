## Bulk Authoring

Bulk authoring allows you to create multiple buttons all at once by focusing on the expressions you want the robot to say and not worrying about the details. The bulk authoring interface has a large text box that allows you to enter your ideas that will get converted into control buttons.

On the right side of the text box are options for how you want to convert your ideas. You can also see a preview or even auto-preview as you type.

The way the bulk authoring works will make the most sense when you try it out. Go through the below list of tasks to really get the value of this authoring interface.

{% include interactive_check.html statement="I entered some ideas in the text box." %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="I tried previewing what the buttons will look like." %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="I tried the auto-preview." %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="I tried the different settings for converting my ideas to buttons." %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="I submitted my ideas and created the buttons." %}

{% include interactive_progress.html %}
