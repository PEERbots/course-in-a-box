title: Now what?

Hopefully at this point you have a grasp of how to control content, but what comes next? Where can you get or make content to use so you can facilitate social robot interactions?

There are two paths to move forward, and we encourage you to try both!

1. Create your own content through Peerbots' authoring interface - which you can learn about in the [authoring module](/modules/author/guidelines).
2. Acquire content through Peerbots' Content Marketplace - which you can learn about in the [community module](/modules/community/acquiring-content)
