## Steps To Setup and Connect to your robot

Before we begin with controlling a robot, you'll need to set it up and follow several steps.

First, you must decide which devices you're going to use. With the Peerbots platform you can go to

{% include interactive_check.html statement="Identify the robot or robot device you plan to use." %}

{% include interactive_check.html statement="Turn on your robot or set up the Peerbots robot face" %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="On the controller device, go to connect to robot" %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="Connect to the robot" %}
{% include interactive_check.html statement="Test sending a message to the robot or robot face or control the robot motion where applicable." %}

{% include interactive_progress.html %}
