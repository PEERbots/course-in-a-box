[Peerbots](peerbots.org) is building social robots for everyone, powered by experts like you! We make it possible for non-roboticists to get started with social robots through the [Peerbots Platform](app.peerbots.org), even without access to what you might traditionally think of as a robot. In this course, you'll learn about all the components of the Peerbots Platform and how to use them effectively to get the most out of your social robot.

- **[Overview](/modules/overview/what-is-peerbots/)** - See the big picture of the Peerbots Platform and how things fit together.
- **[Control](/modules/control/overview)** - Control a robot or robot face and track important information about the interaction.
- **[Author](/modules/authoring/guidelines)** - Design interactions with a social robot and practice them.
